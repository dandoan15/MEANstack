<!-- ALL DIRECTIVES ARE PARSED AND COMPILED BY THE AngularJS compiler; also linked to scopes to produce live views -->

		Modules provide a container for different parts of your app: controllers, services, filters, directives, etc.
		For more information google angularJS [w/e] to learn more information

		In summary, modules are used to manage code injection and are not executed when loaded

		angular.module(name, [requires], [configFn]) 
			name = name of your module to be used for the ng-app="name"
			[requires]= [] parameter in the module definition can be used to define dependent modules(such as other modules, services, other objects registered with the injector service);
						Without the [] parameter, you are not creating a new module, but retrieving an existing one
			[configFn] = defines a function that is called during the configuration stage, to setup module information.

			if you want to include your service within the dependencies, 
			it "MUST MATCH IN ORDER" within the callback function parameters
